        <h2>Work Experience / Projects.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Python desktop application for diagnosis support in patients with suspected COVID-19, pneumonia or bronchitis.<br>
                Using Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Neural networks, I managed to generate an intuitive graphical interface for
                image reading and classification, images such as computer tomography and thoracic x-rays for subsequent improvement, segmentation
                and classification, achieving up to 97% classification accuracy.
            </li>
            <li> Design of a position and depth detection prototype- <br>
                Making use of Python, two digital cameras and patron recognition techniques, in addition to manipulation and feature extraction
                techniques in digital images, I designed a prototype supportive system for location and depth of and object in space.
            </li>
            <li> Java desktop application for store management of musical instruments. <br>
                Based on Java and MySQL, I designed an application supported by a graphical interface for the sale and management of a store of
                musical instruments, implementing functionalities such as shopping cart, table relationship, creation and management of inventories.
            </li>
            <li> Java application for cinema tickets selling. <br>
                Using Java I generated the implementation of a graphical interface application which included functionalities such as ticket sales,
                available places updating as well as the generation of purchase receipts.
